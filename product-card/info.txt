The cn function is likely a utility function for conditionally joining class names. It is commonly used in React projects to dynamically apply CSS classes based on certain conditions. This approach is often seen in libraries like clsx or classnames.

This function takes multiple arguments (class names or conditional expressions), filters out falsy values (like false, undefined, or null), and joins the remaining class names into a single string separated by spaces. It is useful for managing dynamic class names in JSX.

import { clsx } from "clsx"
